I use a selenium for testing with my own forms!!
Creating a test plan;
1. Creating a scenario: checking email and password by creating a right and wrong password.
2. Go to url: open url 
3. Put email and a valid and invalid password each time, expecting a result is pass or not.
4. Writing a document for testing : whenever creating a test scenario, writing a document what you have done and expected on each step.
