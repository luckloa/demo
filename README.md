# Why I am here!
Showing my skills as a tester using automation. I would like to share my memories and expreiences. 

I have learned about html and css. Below are a few example I would like to share. Bootstrap is a css library for creating a dynamic web applications. The Grid system is to arrange elements depending on the device used to view the webpage. There are 12 columns per row and can be used in many different ways.

I have trained with Selenium for automated testing. 
Creating my own forms using Bootstrap and HTML for Selenium testing.

## What I have done.
I used selenium for testing with my own forms!!


## Test script:
1. Selenuim works with Firefox, so install Firefox, if you dont have it on your computer. And then start to download Selenium, you will see features of Selenium. There are divived to Menu bar, Base URL bar, Toolbar, test case pane and Log/Reference/UI-Element/Rollup pane.
2. How to work with Selenium, let's start it's on the top part of Selenium. Type the value of Base URL, Firefox will take you to the page of URL. It is interactive to URL and Selenium.
3. Red button on the right top of Seleniumn is recoding, click it on when you want to test. On the webpage, right click on any content or logo withint the page. This will bring up the Selenium IDE context menu.
4. In the "User Name" and Password, type valid and invalid username and password for testing. After stop recording, Scripts should be shown as commands and parameters. 
5. Save script in a test case, but if there are many test cases, can save as test suite.
6. Click the Playback button on Selenium to execute the whole script. The hightlight will be shown on green, the test all passed.
7. Selenese commands can have two paramenters: target and value. They are not required all the time, it depends on how many the command will need.
8. We can create test scripts either recording or typing the commands and parameters manually by using Firebug to get the locator. 

## Manual test scripts writing:
As the form, we want to test "Username and Password"
1. Click to the first line of panel, put command "Open", and next line type "assertTitle" of command, and put target.
2. Next line, we use command "type", target is "id=email" and put eamil for value.
3. Put "type" in command for next line and put "id=password", value is password.
4. Next use "click", target is "line=Sign up" and then save test scripts as a file.
