# Why I am here!
Showing my skills as a tester using automation. I would like to share my memories and expreiences. 

I have learned about html and css. Below are a few example I would like to share. Bootstrap is a css library for creating a dynamic web applications. The Grid system is to arrange elements depending on the device used to view the webpage. There are 12 columns per row and can be used in many different ways.

I have trained with Selenium for automated testing. 
Creating my own forms using Bootstrap and HTML for Selenium testing.

## What I have done on my purpose.
I use a selenium for testing with my own forms!!
Creating a test plan;
1. Creating a scenario: checking email and password by creating a right and wrong password.
2. Go to url: open url 
3. Put email and a valid and invalid password each time, expecting a result is pass or not.
4. Writing a document for testing : whenever creating a test scenario, writing a document what you have done and expected on each step.
